# Pupil-Teacher Ratio trend around the world and their impact on secondary students' performance, measured by publicly available PISA scores
> This narrative visualisation project focuses on exploring the trend in Pupil-Teacher Ratio for multiple different countries across the world and its impact on secondary students' performance, specifically PISA scores, trying to get a clearer idea whether lowering the ratio leads to better outcomes as often suggested.

<!-- The intended audience are parents, education policy makers and any one interested in the education sector in general.
> Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->
